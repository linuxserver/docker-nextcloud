  [{{ project_name|capitalize }}]({{ project_url }}) gives you access to all your files wherever you are.

  Where are your photos and documents? With Nextcloud you pick a server of your choice, at home, in a data center or at a provider. And that is where your files will be. Nextcloud runs on that server, protecting your data and giving you access from your desktop or mobile devices. Through Nextcloud you also access, sync and share your existing data on that FTP drive at the office, a Dropbox or a NAS you have at home.

  ### Updating Nextcloud

  Updating Nextcloud is done by pulling the new image, and recreating the container with it.

  It is only possible to upgrade one major version at a time. For example, if you want to upgrade from version 14 to 16, you will have to upgrade from version 14 to 15, then from 15 to 16.

  Since all data is stored in the `/config` and `/data` volumes, nothing gets lost. The startup script will check for the version in your volume and the installed docker version. If it finds a mismatch, it automatically starts the upgrade process.

  ### Collaborative Editing

  Nextcloud's built-in collaborative editing packages (Collabora/CODE and OnlyOffice) only work on x86_64 systems with glibc, and therefore they are not compatible with our images. You should create separate containers for them and set them up in Nextcloud with their respective connector addons.

  If (auto) installed, those built-in packages may cause instability and should be removed.

  ### Custom App Directories

  If you are [using custom app directories](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/apps_management.html#using-custom-app-directories) you will need to make the custom folder(s) you are using available to the web server. The recommended way to do this with our container is to add a volume. Ex:

  ```yaml
      volumes:
        - /path/to/your_custom_apps_folder:/app/www/public/your_custom_apps_folder
  ```

  Afterwards, you can set `"path" => OC::$SERVERROOT . "/your_custom_apps_folder",` in your `config.php` file, per the [official documentation](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/apps_management.html#using-custom-app-directories).
